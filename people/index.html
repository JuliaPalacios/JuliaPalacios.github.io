	<td CLASS = "top" VALIGN = top> <p>I am a postdoc at the Department of Statistics, Stanford University. I am currently working on building Bayesian nonparametric coalescent models.  I completed my PhD in May 2023 at the Department of Statistics, Purdue University, where my advisor was Vinayak Rao.
 I have broad research interests in computational statistics and machine learning, involving Gaussian processes, GANs, VAEs, density ratio estimation, etc. Specifically, I am excited about Markov Chain Monte Carlo for doubly intractable problems, generative models satisfying marginal properties, and the density-chasm problem.
Besides my research interests, I like Impressionism in both painting and music, and the Lake Poets.</p></td>

I am broadly interested in developing statistical/mathematical models and working with large data. My current research focuses on stochastic process, probabilistic modeling, Bayesian statistics, with the applications in health, genetics, and cancer. In my free time, I enjoy traveling and visiting national parks.  </p>

My current research focuses on  mathematical properties and statistical inference of multifurcating trees, with applications to infectious diseases. I also work in the global health realm focusing on microplanning models and assessing impacts of health reforms in sub-Saharan Africa. In my free time, I enjoy eating good food, watching sports, and when I can, traveling. </p>

I am currently interested in mathematical questions concerning different types of phylogenetic trees, such as the geometry of various proposed models of tree space. In my free time I like to bike.</p>
