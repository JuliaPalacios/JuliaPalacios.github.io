        <h3>Binjing Tang</h3>
        <p>I am a postdoc at the department of statistics, Stanford University, working with Julia Palacios to build Bayesian nonparametric coalescent models.  I completed my PhD in May 2023 at the department of statistics, Purdue University, where my advisor was Vinayak Rao.
 I have broad research interests in computational statistics and machine learning, involving Gaussian processes, GANs, VAEs, density ratio estimation and etc. Specifically, I am excited about Markov Chain Monte Carlo for doubly intractable problems, generative models satisfying marginal properties, and the density-chasm problem.
Besides my research interests, I like Impressionism in both painting and music, and the Lake Poets.</p>
