        		<h1>Julia A. Palacios</h1>
				<p>I am a statistician interested in mathematical models in evolutionary genomics and estimation of relevant
				parameters in this field. I am also very interested in more general stochastic processes and the development of 
				efficient estimation methods that would have an impact in public health. </p>
				<p>I finished my Ph.D. in the Statistics Department of the University of Washington, Seattle in 2013.
				I worked under the supervision of <a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/~vminin/">Vladimir Minin</a> on the estimation of Effective Population Sizes from gene sequences 
				using Gaussian Processes</p>
				<p>I joined the Ramachandran Lab and the Wakeley Lab as a postdoc. I am working on Bayesian Nonparametric Inference of evolutionary parameters from genomic data.</p>
