		<h1>Palacios Lab</h1>
			
		
		<p>I am interested in developing statistical methods to better understand complex stochastic phenomenons. 
		   I am currently working on efficient statistical inference and efficient probabilistic modeling in evolutionary genomics, infectious diseases and in more general stochastic processes
		   that would have an impact in public health.</p>
			
		<p>Our group is working on diverse topics that include the development of Bayesian nonparametric methods, new tools for computational statistics, development of new coalescent models and efficient MCMC methods. We are working on several applications in genetics, biology, health and cancer.</p>

		<!-- <p>Alan Aw </p> Alan's project investigates mathematical properties of molecular genetic statistics. The site frequency spectrum (SFS), computed from genomic data, is used to infer evolutionary histories, including selection, bottlenecks and expansions. The lack of tractable mathematical formulas for the distribution of SFS-based statistics under various demographic models has led to the reliance on hypothesis testing methods to infer demographic history. Using analytical methods, we obtain model-free bounds placed by parameters of the sampled data on the SFS, which guide the visualization and interpretation of SFS-based summary statistics for demographic inference and help explain mathematical constraints placed by one statistic on another.
