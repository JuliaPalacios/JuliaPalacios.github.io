		<h1>Palacios Group</h1>
			
		<p>Our goal is to develop and use statistical methods to understand observed genetic variation in humans and pathogens. 
		   We are interested in efficient statistical inference and efficient probabilistic modeling in evolutionary genomics, infectious diseases and in more general stochastic processes
		   that would have an impact in public health.</p>

			when I was an undergraduate student at Peking University. 
			I gained my interest in statistics, especially in machine learning, during my studies at Stanford. 
			I am working on Empirical Bayes methods for inference in population genetics. 
			I am planning to apply for PhD program in Statistics this year.</p>
